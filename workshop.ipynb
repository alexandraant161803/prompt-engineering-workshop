    "## Introduction to Prompt Engineering with Generative AI\n",
    "Welcome to this workshop on prompt engineering for GenAI! In this session, you'll learn how to write effective prompts that will help you communicate efficiently with large language models like OpenAI's GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: Write a Job Ad for Company X for Position Y.\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to write a job ad for a specific role at a chosen company. Imagine that you are an HR specialist at Company X, and you need to create an engaging and informative job ad for a position Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Prompt Structure\n",
    "We'll use two distinct types of prompts:\n",
    "1. The **System Message**: This sets the stage for the AI, describing its role and how it should behave.\n",
    "2. The **User Message**: This specifies what we are asking the AI to do in the context established by the system message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips for Effective Prompt Engineering:\n",
    "- Specify the task clearly.\n",
    "- Provide a detailed context to guide the AI.\n",
    "- Be straightforward and unambiguous.\n",
    "- Use examples to illustrate your expectations.\n",
    "- Iterate and refine your prompts based on the AI's output."
