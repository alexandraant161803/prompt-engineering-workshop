# Prompt Engineering Workshop Setup Guide
Welcome to this Prompt Engineering Workshop! This purpose of this workshop is to help you practice on writing prompts and interacting with the Azure OpenAI API. 

## 1. Cloning the Workshop Repository
First, we need to get the workshop materials onto your computer by cloning the code repository.

### What you need:
- A terminal application, which allows you to type and execute text-based commands.
- Git installed (if you don't have it, download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

### Steps:
 
1. **Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:**
   - **Windows**: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" and open it.
   - **Mac**: Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and open it.
   - **Linux**: Search for "Terminal" or press "Ctrl + Alt + T" to open it.

2. **Create a New Folder and Navigate There:**
   - Decide on a location where you want to store your workshop materials. For example, you can create a new folder in your "Documents" directory.
   - Type `cd` followed by the path to your chosen location, then press Enter.
     - Example: `cd /Users/yourusername/Documents/workshop`
3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - In your terminal, paste the following command: 
     - `git clone https://github.com/alexandraant161803/prompt-engineering-workshop.git`
   - After the cloning is complete, you will find a new folder called "prompt-engineering-workshop" with all the code inside.

## 2. Start using Jupyter notebook 

### Steps:

1. Open your web browser and go to (https://jupyter.org/try)

5. Select the `workshop.ipynb` file from the `promp-engineering-workshop` folder you cloned from this repository earlier.
6. Once the file is uploaded, click on it to open and start the workshop exercises.

**Congratulations!** You are now all set up for the Prompt Engineering Workshop. Enjoy your learning experience!
